# Laptop Setup Time!

Run `mac.sh` on your shiney new Mac to get some links to items that still
need to be installed as well as recommended optional installs.

Instead of automatically installing software as some computer setups scripts
do, we instead provide links to the software's websites in case installation
instructions require attention. This has the positive side effect of not having
to rely on potentially third party installation scripts for the applications
you rely on to be secure.

## Testing

You can lint the application scripts by running `bin/lint` after installing
[shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).
